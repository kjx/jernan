* CS2J at least makes the files.
* BUT: everything seems broken everywhere!

* in particular: C# literal hashmaps FUCK everything
 - made auxuiliary hash(k,v) hash(k,v,k,v) hash(h,v,k,v,k,v) 

24 July 6pm - Lexer parses. I think. 

24 July 8pm or thereabouts - nasty versions of Unicode helper classes 

24 July 8:40pm - compiled first file  StaticErrorException.java

24 July 9:23pm - compiles OutputSink (1 line!!)

24 July 10:34pm ErrorReporting compiles!  This is due to a big HACK in
Token, but still...

24 July 11:30 fucking about, adding StringInfo to Grace;
probaby have to add (some of) StringSupport too; 

24 July 12:36 Lexer.java compiles!!!!!


====

25 July 13:50. spent the morning doing email and stuff.
Lexer.java means all the Tokens compile too. 
I can test it...

25 July 14:12. first Lexer test runs: seems good to me!
made Grace.Tests directory.  Should do real tests. sometime.

25 July 14:35 lexed hellow world.

25 July 14:55 spend 20 minutes tracking down a "bug"
   that turned out not to be a bug. Rather the lexer must be 
   triggererd by the parser to handle interpolation properly.
   RBrace { terminates a string literal, and then things run amok.

25 July 15:00 made a version of combinators will all braces escaped
   lexes fine.  added and commited

25 July 16:37 went around the museum, walking back towards the hotel.
   half pint of cider (cos the tap wouldn't pour a full pint!).

25 July 19:04 kept working on the parser.
 bunch of stupid stuff: added Staick class, fixed Array and ArrayList
 etc. started to put in the generic .class paramters --- figured out
 that CS2J had LEFT THE DAMN THINGS OUT.   Going through Parser.cs to
 put them back in again!

25 July 19:36 clean compile of Parser.
 
25 July 20:35 FUCK ME. Parsed combinators.grace!!
  output *nearly* identitcal to Kernan, signature and method decln are
  wrong.
